# What should gov-begin do next?

The following questions remain to be answered:

* what are the mandate and powers of the government being formed
* what is the shape of the larger group and executive council
* what are the rules for electing, aging out, and refilling seats
* what are the rules for changing the group's rules of operation
* what other rules of operation exist for the government's operation
* who are the initial members of the government
* do we agree to ratify the final result of all the above decisions?

---

**A:**  We will collect proposals for complete government constitutions and
        vote on those.

* We will have a period of two weeks in which to propose governments.  Anyone
  on the list may propose a constitution, and may amend their proposal at will.
  All proposals will be submitted by GitHub pull request, details to be
  determined.

* At the end of the two weeks, the gov-begin moderator will take a snapshot of
  all proposals, publish them, and conduct a preferential ballot between them,
  with a one week voting limit.

**B:**  We will conduct a series of ballots on the individual questions of
        governance to be answered.

* The gov-begin moderator will begin a series of votes to progress us through
  the questions above.
* Each ballot will answer one or more of the questions above, chosen and
  grouped at my discretion.
* For each ballot, there will be a one week period to submit ballot options.
  Any option proposed and seconded by members of the list will be present.
  (The gov-begin moderator will provide strict rules to make clear how one
  alters their proposal.)
* Following the one week period to submit options, there will be a four day
  voting period.
* At the end of the series of decisions, we will proceed to gather and vote on
  whole-constitution as described in option (A).

**C:**  We will collect proposals for rules of order for the gov-begin list
        discussions and vote for the rules under which we shall proceed. This
        process shall be conducted under the same terms as option A.

**D:**  We affirm our confidence in the current leadership and structure of the
        Perl project governance. The proceedings of the gov-begin list are
        concluded.

**E:**  I support none of the above options.
