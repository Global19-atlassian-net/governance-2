A:  We will collect proposals for complete government constitutions and vote on
    those.

* We will have a period of two weeks in which to propose governments.  Anyone
  on the list may propose a constitution, and may amend their proposal at will.
  All proposals will be conducted by GitHub pull request, details to be
  determined.

* At the end of the two weeks, I will take a snapshot of all proposals,
  publish them, and conduct a preferential ballot between them, with a one
  week voting limit.

B:  We should conduct a series of ballots on the individual questions of
    governance to be answered.

* I will begin a series of votes to progress us through the questions above.
* Each ballot will answer one or more of the questions above, chosen and
  grouped at my discretion.
* For each ballot, there will be a one week period to submit ballot options.
  Any option proposed and seconded by members of the list will be present.  (I
  will provide strict rules to make clear how one alters their proposal.)
* Following the one week period to submit options, there will be a four day
  voting period.
* At the end of the series of decisions, we will revert to the actions
  described for option (A), with the proviso that any proposed constitution
  meet the requirements voted on over the course of the ballots for the above
  questions.

C:  We will collect proposals for rules of order for the gov-begin list
    discussions and vote for the rules under which we shall proceed. This
    process shall be conducted under the same terms as option A.

D:  We affirm our confidence in the current leadership and structure of the
    Perl project governance. The proceedings of the gov-begin list are
    concluded.
